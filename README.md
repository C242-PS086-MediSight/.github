## **Introduction**  
MediSight is a mobile application designed to assist individuals in identifying and managing minor wounds through machine learning-based image classification. The app addresses the lack of reliable guidance for self-treatment, which often results in improper care and delayed healing.  

### Key Features:  
1. **Wound Classification**: Detect minor wound types such as burns, cuts, bruises, and abrasions.  
2. **Wound Care**: Provide step-by-step care instructions and recommend suitable medications or products.  
3. **Health Service Locator**: Help users find pharmacies or healthcare facilities.  
4. **Wound Care Articles**: Access a collection of articles about wound treatment, tips, tricks, and self-care practices.  
5. **Chatbot Assistant**: Provide users with additional information about wound care.
